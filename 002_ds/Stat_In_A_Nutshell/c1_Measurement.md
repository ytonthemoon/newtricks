Nominal data
Categorical, names, labels, no math operations, no comparison 
eg, gender

Ordinal data
Order is important, can compare
eg, ratings

Interval data
Can subtract, add, compare, can't take ratio
eg. temperature

Ratio data
all operations ok, 
eg. money, weight, height

Operationalization
Methods to measure a concept that is not measurable (eg. IQ)

Proxy Measurement
When it is costly or difficult to obtain some measurement, use proxy measurements

X = T + E
X : observed score
T: true score
E: error score
T & E are not directly measureable, but we can use X to estimate them

E = random! + systematic?
Random Error
random, cancel out, inevitable, can be minimised
Systematic Error
observable pattern, avoidable,
